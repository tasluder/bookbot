# bookbot
BookBot is my first project!

## purpose
This project is supposed to take the text of a book (or other form of text), and it will return two things (for now):
1. The number of words in the novel.
2. The number of times each character (letter) appears.

## ways to improve this project
i think this project could be improved upon by bolstering the report with a few items:
* The most common word in the novel (it would be neat to build a dictionary of articles and prepositions and *exclude* those words from the results.)
* The most unique word (least appearances)
